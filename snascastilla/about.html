                    <p>The <b>Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA)</b> is a government agency tasked to manage and supervise technical education and skills development (TESDA) in the Philippines. It was created under  Republic Act 7796, otherwise known as the TESDA Act of 1994. The said Act integrated the functions of the   National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC), the Bureau of Technical   Vocational Education of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (BTVE-DECS) and the Office of Apprenticeship of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE).</p>
                    <p><b>Formulation of TVET plans and policies</b><p>
                    <p>Programs and services relating to technical vocational education and training embody the role of TESDA as the Authority in TVET. These are aimed at providing clear directions and priorities for TVET in the country. These include the  formulation of plans and policies for the TVET sector and the generation through  researches and studies and dissemination of relevant data and information for informed decision of stakeholders of the sector.</p>                                                            
                    
                    <p><b>Competency Standards Development</b><p>
                    <p>The program aims at developing standards and systems that will align middle-level skills qualifications with industry standards. The competency standards shall be the bases in assessing the qualifications of the middle-level skilled workers through the competency assessment and certification program.</p>
                    <p><b>Competency Assessment and Certification</b><p>
                    <p>The program aims at assessing and certifying the competencies of the middle-level skilled workers under the Philippine TVET Qualification and Certification System (PTQCS). The assessment process is done to confirm if the graduate or worker can perform the standard expected in the workplace based on the defined competency standards. Certification is provided to those who meet the competency standards. This ensures the productivity, quality and global competitiveness of middle-level workers.
                    <b>TESDA</b> has a Registry of Certified Workers which provides information on the pool of certified workers for certain occupations nationwide.
                    <b>TESDA</b> has accredited assessment centers as well as competency assessors who conduct competency assessment processes to persons applying for certification.<p>

                    <div class="title"><h5>Historical Background</h5></div>
                    <p>The Sorsogon National Agricultural School, originally named Castilla, Agricultural High School was created by the virtue of the RA No. 6565, on September 30, 1972 but later renamed to its present name (Sorsogon National Agricultural School) by authority of the President of the Philippines on August 27, 1974 through the representation of the Board of Sorsogon.</p>

                    <p>The school site per  PD No. 233 is located at Mayon, Castilla, Sorsogon, with an area of 250 hectare, as surveyed later. It provides an ideal agricultural site due to its     topography, suitability to agricultural projects, accessibility and possibility for expansion. In June 26, 1996, the Sorsogon State College represented by the President, Dr. Augusto R. Nieves heartedly donated a parcel of one(1) hectare land to the Department of Education Culture and Sports (DECS) Sorsogon National Agricultural High School headed by the    Regional Director, Atty. Victoriano B. Tirol Jr.. In addition, in December 15, 1999, Mr. Gerry Prieto sold a lot of one (1) hectare land to Sorsogon National Agricultural School with an amount of P100, 000.00. A portion of this coconut land was transferred and registered   under Act 3444. It was then again year 2001, when Mr. Prieto generously donated 2.2   hectares to Sorsogon National Agricultural School in the name of the Vocational School  Administrator, Mr. Bueno O. Mendez. The land was officially transferred dated December 27, 2001 under ARP No. 96060180418. The total of 4.2 hectares land area of the school was utilized for school building and agribusiness project were these areas earned from   several donors and sellers.</p>

                    <p>The school was recognized under the direct supervision of the Director of the   Bureau of Vocational Education (BVE) of the Department of Education and Culture (DEC) now DECS, through the superintendent of Sorsogon School of Arts and Trade (SSAT) of Sorsogon, Sorsogon. Its initial operation stated during the school year 1974-1975, with an enrolment of 74 first year students only, all males and manned by pioneer working staff of seven(7) headed by a principal (Mr. Mauricio J. Medialda) three (3)teachers and facilitative staff comprising the storekeeper, accounting clerk and farm aide. The first commencement exercises of the school under the secondary vocational agriculture curriculum took place in SY 1977-1978 under new Principal Engineer Dominador T. Martinez.<p>

                    <p>The following school year 1978-1979, the school offered a two-year Technical course in Agriculture or Post-Secondary course, owing to its desire to cater to the needs of the students, the parents and the community. The enrolment at that time reached up to 700 plus both secondary and post-secondary combined, although operating only under a budget for secondary program and a workforce of 32, teaching and non-teaching staff.</p>                        

                    <p>The desire of the administration to provide the youth of the entire province the     opportunities to develop their skills and prepare for a lifelong gainful occupation based on agriculture technology, was further strengthened when it opened a tie-up program with the Bicol  University through BUCA by way of entering into a Memorandum of Agreement whereby     BUCA extended its available resources to the SNAS in order to strengthen not only its      instructional capability but also its research and extension program. Under this agreement, SNAS has to develop and implement a curriculum that will satisfy the TPAE minimum     standard requirement for any degree program where the two-year SNAS curriculum would fit in   collaboration BUCA, Guinobatan, Albay and the SNAS students eventually will be        admitted to any degree program that BUCA is offering after two year of the implementation of the curriculum.<p>
                    
                    <p>This program was started in 1984 during the administration of Mr. Emilio A. Tamayo as officer in charge and continued by the same principal Engr. Dominador T. Martinez when the latter was reinstated to his office in 1987.</p>

                    <p>As the institution grows, it normally expects to expand its services to the community but     ironically, the school started to experience crisis in the enrolment both in secondary and post-secondary primarily attracted to the factors related to the 1998 implementation of free secondary education program of the government, under the RA 6565, and the subsequent offering of the General High Schools in the different barangays around the vicinity of SNAS. This situation was further aggravated by the peace and order condition of the place moreover, the negative attitude long persist  among the youth towards agriculture or farming program, notwithstanding some negative aspects on the part of administration with respect to its     facilities and logistics problems.<p>

                    <p>However, prevailing situation was timely abated when Mr. Rodolfo Maralit of Daraga, Albay donated a one (1) hectare lot at San Rafael, Castilla, Sorsogon in favor of DECS SNAS through the efforts of some community leaders and barangay officials who showed interest of opening a new high school in the said barangay. This paved the way for the establishment of the SNAS extension classes at San Rafael, Castilla, Sorsogon starting SY 1991-1997 to date.<p>

                    <p>A new classroom building was constructed on the newly donated  school site after a year of occupation of the administration-built temporary classroom and a vacant public market     building for its initial classes held at the barangay Poblacion of San Rafael and continuously existed for seven years in service.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Emilio A. Tamayo, then the Officer-in-charge made the institution grows and   behind SNAS elevation to TESDA administered school in Sorsogon. On March 22, 1997, a major development took place. </p>
                    
                    <p>The Law RA 7666, mandates that the college shall provide a higher professional, technical, special instruction and promote research and extension services, advance     studies and    progressive leadership in education, especially arts and sciences and other fields as maybe relevant; it shall offer undergraduate and graduate courses in the said field studies as the board of trustees may deemed necessary to carry out its objectives; and shall offer       short-term, terminal courses or vocational courses within its area of         specialization to meet the needs of the nation. It further provides for the transfer of the   existing high school under the supervision of the DECS now Department of Education and the property and assets       including the personnel and records of the school integrated to the State College be turned over to the Sorsogon State College. RA No. 7666 was enacted converting the Sorsogon College of Arts and Trade (then SSAT) in the municipality of Sorsogon, province of Sorsogon, into a State College, integrating therewith the  Magallanes School of Fisheries in the municipality of Castilla, and the Bulan Vocational High school in the municipality of  Bulan.</p>

                    <p>In the process of its implementation of the conversation of the three (3) vocational schools/campuses into state college, it turned out that the names of all school integrated therein except the Sorsogon State College of Arts and Trades were retained including some of its faculty or teachers and eventually place them and the high school program under the     jurisdiction and supervision of the DECS beginning the school year 1995-1996. However, these existing separated/ retained schools are still provided with its own budgetary         allocation for its personnel services and other operating or maintenance expenses through the DECS Regional Office. Another favorable gesture provided by its conversation of the schools operation of 3 existing high school is that they are allowed to stay at the same campuses until such time that they shall have provided. </p>

                    <p>Then, All Technical Vocational institutions were transferred under TESDA        supervision. Hence, SNAS stands until now as TESDA training institution. When SNAS was under the supervision of TESDA, Mr. Bueno O. Mendez has been the Vocational School Administrator from March 22, 1997 until December 7, 2004. After which, he applied for sick leave that gave way to Ms. Romana B. Bermillo, Asst. Prof. I who took charge as Officer in Charge for two years and two months. It was in February 27, 2007, when Dr. Anita B. De Guzman, the Technology Department Head of CASIFMAS, Pasacao, Camarines Sur was appointed as Vocational School Administrator I by the TESDA Central Office until her    retirement in     December 31, 2013. Mr. Conrado Ll. Lopez Jr. was assigned as Caretaker from January. 2014 to August 31, 2014.  It was then, year 2014 of September 1, when    Ms. Leonor B. Diaz, a Regional Operations Division OIC-Chief of TESDA Region V,       assigned to be the new   Vocational School Administrator III of the institution up to this  present year.</p>
